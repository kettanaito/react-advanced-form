import { Input, Radio } from 'react-advanced-form-addons';

export default class RegistrationForm extends React.Component {
  registerUser = ({ serialized, fields, form }) => {
    return fetch('https://backend.dev/user', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(serialized)
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Form action={ this.registerUser }>
