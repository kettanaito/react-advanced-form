> Thank you for trying React Advanced Form! Please note that before the `1.0` release the package is under heavy development. Things may change, and things may break. We are doing our best and releasing breaking changes in the proper versions. Help us reach `1.0` faster by [Contributing](#contributing) to the library. Thank you.

[React Advanced Form](https://github.com/kettanaito/react-advanced-form) allows you to tailor complex forms with ease, using declerative components and powerful built-in features. Write forms like you have never done before!

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (6.0+)

#### Peer dependencies
This package requires the [peer dependencies](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) listed below to function properly. It is your responsibility to install/have those in your project, alongside the installation of the package itself.
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) (15.0+)
* [ImmutableJS](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js) (3.8+)

### Install
#### NPM:
```bash
npm install react-advanced-form --save
```

#### Yarn:
```bash
yarn add react-advanced-form
```

### Basic usage
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Form, Field } from 'react-advanced-form';
import { Input, Radio } from 'react-advanced-form-addons';

export default class RegistrationForm extends React.Component {
  registerUser = ({ serialized, fields, form }) => {
    return fetch('https://backend.dev/user', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(serialized)
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Form action={ this.registerUser }>
        <Input name="username" required />
        <Input name="password" type="password" required />

        <Radio name="gender" value="male" />
        <Radio name="gender" value="female" />

        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </Form>
    );
  }
}
```

> **Note:** We are using [`react-advanced-form-addons`](https://github.com/kettanaito/react-advanced-form-addons) prototyping library in this example. You *don't need* to use it in your projects, as you are about to implement your custom fields easily with the tools exposed by React Advanced Form.

See the [Official documentation](https://kettanaito.gitbooks.io/react-advanced-form) for more information on components, methods and usage examples.
