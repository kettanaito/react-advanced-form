# Third-party fields integration

React Advanced Form is not only a form solution, it is a form ecosystem. That means that you can make *anything* to be treated as a field, while the form ensures its proper functionality. It is made possible by events-based architecture, so that the field behavior is standardized and predictable.

Even a plain `div` can be treated as a field component, as long as you describe its interactions pattern using the tools exposed by React Advanced Form. Of course, that applies to any third-party field library as well.

This directory contains the list of examples on third-party solutions integration with React Advanced Form.
