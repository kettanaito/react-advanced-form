# Concept

## The motivation
This library has been concieved after numerous attempts to come up with the solution I would personally prefer. Neither of the existing form libraries satisfied my expectations toward this topic. Some were overcomplicating the code, others required absurd amount of boilerplate to write in order to get a simple form working. Needless to say, even the most popular form libraries lacked, what seemed, the crucial features the one would expect (i.e. field formatting or control over serialized data). To be honest, I am not following those libraries now, and there is a high chance they adopted those features by the time React Advanced Form is in the condition it is now. But at the time I needed them, they were nowhere.

## Idea

### Simplicity
The form should work as simple as including required components, configuring them with the *props* and... that's all. I personally find extra configurations "from outside" and even manual `onChange` management of each field as a huge overkill you don't need in 99% of use cases. Don't get me wrong, I cherish the idea of controlled components, and controlled form inputs as well, but when this is really benefitial to the developer.

Consider this example:

```jsx
import { Form, Field } from '...';

export default function RegistrationForm() {
  registerUser = () => {
  }

  render() {
    <Form action={ this.registerUser }>
      <Field.Input
        name="username"
        required />
      <Field.Input
        name="password"
        type="password"
        required />
    </Form>
  }
}
```

Everything has been provided in order for the form to work: which fields are in the form, their requirement state, and what should happen on form submit. That should be literally all you need to setup the simpliest form.

**However**, the form shouldn't be excessively simple either. This would mean that the library deligates too much on the shoulders of the developer, forcing him to write things which should be within by form (field updates, validation, serialization).

### Versatile
The form should be, although simple, but reach for the feature which may be needed. I don't find a simple fields rendering system as a sufficient solution for real-world applications. I don't want to write boilerplate code each time I want to create a new form. I expect the form to handle what it was designed to handle.

#### Field management
React Advanced Form *still* keeps the fields as controlled components. The difference is that they are controlled on the Form level, depriving the developer of unnecessary `onChange` handlers. You can still make the field controlled by you, just as you would do with the native `Input`: provide a `value` and `onChange` props. However, you are not forced into doing so.

#### Validation
The developer is but to provide the validation rules applicable to the form and validation messages displayed correspondingly to those rules. He shouldn't handle the process of validation as is, but should be able to hook into it in case of necessity.

Read more on how [Validation](./validation.md) works in RAF.

#### Serialization
When the Form is the one handling serialization, the latter becomes a pure function. You never really want to distort the logic or the output of field serialization. What you often want is to reshape the serialized Object at a certain point (i.e. just before sending to the remote end-point). That use case should not be covered during the serialization process, but rather in some submit callback handler.

Read more on how [Serialization](./serialization.md) works in RAF.

#### Submit callback handlers
Form should tell you when it starts submitting, had submitted or failed doing so. You are not the one who should to determine when those events happen.

Read more how you can handle submit events using flexible [Submit callback methods](./submit.md#callback-methods).

### Styling
You couldn't find a modern website which uses native form elements. Custom form styles has become a must in modern design, and for a good reason. That means this should apply to the form you are using as well.

There were a few key points toward custom styling:
1. It should be separated from the form logic.
1. It should be easy to use.
1. It should be completely up to developer how the field should look like.

Read more on how to provide [Custom styling](./custom-styling.md) for your forms with ease.

## Drawbacks
### Library size
Each choice echoes with the consequence. As the form handles quite a few things on its own, it will, eventually, be bigger in size than compared with the other solutions, which tend to give all these responsibilities to the end developer. However, in the long run, if you sum up the amount of boilerplate those libraries expect from you, the code size would be much bigger than using a solution which does the vital handling for you.

### Context
Using of context opens a lot of great features to the form, but should be treated carefully and safely.
