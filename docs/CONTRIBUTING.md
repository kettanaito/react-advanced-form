## Foreword
First of all, thank you for deciding to contribute to React Advanced Form! It is only by the power of the community we can achieve great results.

## Technologies
A good place to start is to ensure you are familiar with the technologies used in React Advanced Form.

* **Development:**
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/) to power the components
  * [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js) for variables management
* **Testing:**
  * [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) as the assertion library
  * [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for plain unit tests
  * [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for React unit tests
  * [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for integration tests.

## General agreements
Please read and respect the internal agreements listed below. The latter are to ensure the quality and seamless coding approach during the development of the library.

### Versioning
* Please **do not** version the changes you provide. Versioning happens by the repository's owners after your changes are merged into the `master` branch.

### Naming conventions
1. Use `PascalCase` and `.jsx` extension for React components.
1. Use `cammelCase` and `.js` extension for other JavaScript files.
1. Use `.spec.js` suffix for the test files.
1. Be familiar with the [Naming Cheatsheet](https://github.com/kettanaito/naming-cheatsheet). It contains quite a few of patterns and pieces of advice on how to name the methods, variables and anything in general.
1. Once the review is passed, merge your pull request or ask somebody else to do so. Your contribution is now merged into the `master` and prepared for the next release!

### Git workflow
1. Create a new branch with the proper prefix. Use `feature` prefix for new features, `bugfix` for bugfixes and `dev` for internal (i.e. architectural) improvements. **Examples:** `feature/field-format`, `bugfix/form-clear`, `dev/bundle-size`.
1. Contribute the changes.
1. Add the changes with `git add`.
1. Commit the changes with `git commit`.
1. `git checkout master` and `git pull --rebase` to pull the latest changes from the `master` branch.
1. `git checkout PREFIX/YOUR_FEATURE_BRAHC` and `git rebase master` to ensure your feature branch is up-to-date.
1. Create a [Pull request](https://github.com/kettanaito/react-advanced-form/pulls) in the React Advanced Form repository.
1. Pass the code review and implement possible suggestions and comments from the repository's maintainers and owners.

## Getting started

### Contribute
Development process generally consist of the following steps:

1. Create a test scenario (story) to test your changes.
1. Import a source fields of the library into the created story.
1. Develop with live updates.

### Write tests
**IT IS MANDATORY TO COVER YOUR CHANGES WITH THE CORRESPONDING TESTS.**

Depending on the character of your changes, it may be a unit test(s), integration test(s), or both. Please read more on the [Testing guidelines](./TESTING.md), as well as some test examples in the respective section of the documentation.

### Commit the changes
Follow the [Git workflow](#git-workflow) described above.

Each your commit is followed by an automated build and tests run toward your changes. It is only when the build succeeded and all tests passed your commit is being created. Make sure to fix all the issues which may happen during this process.

### Create a Pull request
Create [a new pull request](https://github.com/kettanaito/react-advanced-form/pulls) featuring your changes in the RAF repository. Assign the pull request to one of the library owners or contributors and await for the comment or approval. Pull request are merged into `master` branch by its reviewer.
